# ✍️ Interactive Poetry & Text Art Theory Cheat Sheet

A practical guide to help students create poetic, narrative, and text-based interactive works using JavaScript, p5.js, HTML, and creative coding techniques.

---

## 1. What Makes Text “Interactive”?

Interactive poetry involves:
- **Reader agency** (click, hover, drag, type)
- **Dynamic text** (words change over time or based on input)
- **Nonlinear structure** (branching, conditional, generative)
- **Multimodality** (sound, motion, visuals)

The poem becomes *an environment*, not just a page.

---

## 2. Core Concepts from Literary Theory

### Reader-Response Theory
Meaning is created *in interaction with the reader*.
Perfect for:
- branching stories  
- clickable poems  
- generative interfaces  

### Constraint-Based Writing (Oulipo)
Rules generate creativity.
Examples:
- N+7 transformations  
- lipograms  
- cut-ups  
- algorithmic rewritings  

### Concrete Poetry
Words form shapes; the page is part of the meaning.

Useful for:
- p5.js text-in-shape  
- typographic animations  

### Procedural Literature
Text generated by instructions or algorithms.
This is the root of:
- generative poetry  
- interactive fiction systems  
- remix machines

## 3. Text as Material

Teach students to see text as something they can:
- shuffle  
- stretch  
- animate  
- fragment  
- layer  
- mask  
- recombine  

Useful transformations:
- split into characters/words  
- rearrange arrays  
- re-color or fade  
- reveal letter-by-letter  
- distort with noise()  

---

## 4. Narrative Structure for Interactive Works

### Branching Logic
Each choice → leads to different states.

Example:
```js
if (choice === "forest") {
  text("You walk into the dark trees...");
}
```

### State Machines
Track where the user is in the story.

States might represent:
- scenes  
- emotional modes  
- rooms / locations  
- stanzas  

### Nonlinear Narrative Patterns
- maze-like  
- cyclical  
- modular  
- hypertext  
- fractal  
- spatial storytelling  

---

## 5. Visual Text Art Principles

### Typographic Hierarchy
Use:
- size  
- weight  
- spacing  
- alignment  

to guide attention.

### Kinetic Typography
Text in motion:
- fades  
- slides  
- pulses  
- rotates  
- trails  

### Spatial Poetics
Where a word sits on screen affects meaning:
- top = distant / elevated  
- bottom = grounded / heavy  
- center = emphasis  
- periphery = uncertainty

## 6. p5.js Techniques for Text Art

### Basic Text
```js
textSize(32);
text("hello world", 50, 100);
```

### Animated Text
```js
text("floating", x + sin(frameCount*0.05)*10, y);
```

### Reveal Text One Letter at a Time
```js
let sub = poem.substring(0, frameCount);
text(sub, 50, 50);
```

### Text as Particles
- each letter becomes an object  
- apply forces, noise, or interaction  

---

## 7. Generative Poetry Patterns

### Markov Chains (Simple)
Generate new text based on probabilities.

### Grammar-Based Systems
Define structures:
```
S → NP VP
NP → "the" ADJ NOUN
```

### Substitution Systems
Replace nouns, verbs, or adjectives.

### Cut-Up Machine
Shuffle lines or fragments.

### Data-Driven Poetics
Text shaped by:
- weather  
- time of day  
- user input  
- randomness  

---

## 8. Interaction Patterns

### Hover
Words react when the cursor passes over.

### Click
Reveals new stanzas or branches.

### Drag
Moves words around the screen like puzzle pieces.

### Typing Input
The reader contributes text.

### Timing
Lines appear or vanish based on time intervals.

---

## 9. Sound + Poetry (Optional but Powerful)

Use Tone.js to:
- emphasize key lines  
- map emotion → harmony  
- create ambient scenes  
- attach sounds to interactions  

Minimal example:
```js
synth.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "8n");
```

---

## 10. Visual + Poetic Composition Tips

- Avoid clutter—white space is poetic.  
- Use movement sparingly; not everything needs to animate.  
- Pair one major interaction with one major visual idea.  
- Use consistent typographic rules.  
- Test readability (contrast, size, timing).  

---

## 11. Common Mistakes in Interactive Poems

- Too many fonts or colors  
- Overly chaotic animations  
- No clear reader agency  
- Text that’s too small or too fast  
- Crowded layouts  
- Interaction that isn’t meaningful  

---

## 12. Prompts for Student Projects

- Rewrite a poem each time it’s read.  
- Make a “breathing poem” that expands and shrinks.  
- Turn a stanza into an explorable map.  
- Build a text instrument (click → sound → word).  
- Create a poem that falls apart and rebuilds itself.  
- Build a poem that reacts to the user’s mouse path.  
- Use randomness to create infinite stanzas.  

---

## 13. Teaching Metaphors

- “Text is clay — shape it.”  
- “Interaction is a verb; poems can respond.”  
- “Meaning emerges in the reader’s hands.”  
- “Rules don’t limit creativity — they generate it.”  
- “Letters are particles; words are constellations.”
