# ✏️ Drawing Theory Cheat Sheet for Creative Coding

A practical guide to essential drawing concepts useful for generative art, p5.js sketches, interaction design, and visual composition.

---

## 1. Seeing vs. Knowing

Beginners draw what they *think* an object looks like instead of what they actually *see*.  
Key skills:
- Observe angles, proportions, and negative space.
- Break objects into simple shapes.
- Avoid symbolic drawing (“eye = almond shape”).

---

## 2. Shape → Form → Value

### Shape
2D outlines: circles, squares, triangles, irregular polygons.

### Form
Turning shapes into 3D illusions using:
- light & shadow  
- perspective  
- overlap  
- foreshortening  

### Value
Light → dark scale that creates depth.

Value is often **more important** than color.

---

## 3. Light & Shadow Basics

Every form has:
- **Highlight**
- **Midtones**
- **Core Shadow**
- **Reflected Light**
- **Cast Shadow**

Understanding light direction helps with:
- shading algorithms  
- generative lighting  
- depth-driven color mapping  

---

## 4. Gesture: The Essence of Movement

Gesture drawing captures:
- flow  
- rhythm  
- action  
- overall proportions  

Core rule: **Start loose, then refine.**

In creative coding:
- particle systems  
- animated strokes  
- motion trails  

all draw directly from gesture logic.

---

## 5. Negative Space

Negative space = the space *around* the subject.

Why it matters:
- helps with proportion  
- simplifies busy compositions  
- improves layout clarity  

In p5.js:
- treat the background as an intentional shape  

---

## 6. Proportion & Measurement Systems

Useful tools:
- sighting verticals/horizontals  
- comparing lengths (“head is 1/7 of body”)  
- using reference grids  

In creative coding:
- grid-based layouts  
- proportional spacing  
- consistent scaling  

---

## 7. Perspective (Simplified)

You don’t need full technical perspective.  
Just brush up on:

### 1-Point Perspective
- lines converge to one vanishing point  
- used for roads, hallways, simple spaces  

### 2-Point Perspective
- two vanishing points  
- used for cubes, buildings, boxes  

### Atmospheric Perspective
- distance = lighter + bluer  
- useful for generative landscapes  

---

## 8. Composition Principles

### Rule of Thirds
Divide the frame into a 3 × 3 grid; place focal points on intersections.

### Balance
- symmetrical (stable)
- asymmetrical (dynamic)

### Visual Hierarchy
Guide the viewer’s eye using:
- size  
- contrast  
- placement  
- value  

### Rhythm & Repetition
Repeating elements create harmony and movement.

---

## 9. Line Quality & Mark-Making

Lines can be:
- thick or thin  
- smooth or jagged  
- fast or slow  
- mechanical or expressive  

Mark-making generates style:
- crosshatching → texture  
- stippling → softness  
- broken lines → subtlety  

In code:
- strokeWeight  
- noise-based jitter  
- alpha blending  
- repeated patterns  

---

## 10. Abstraction & Reduction

Abstraction = distilling to essentials.

Strategies:
- simplify shapes  
- exaggerate features  
- remove detail  
- use symbols  

Perfect for:
- generative portraits  
- data-driven visuals  
- shape-based self-portraits  

---

## 11. Drawing as Iteration

Professional artists:
- sketch → refine → finalize  
- “block in big forms first”  
- work from general to specific  

This mirrors:
- iterative coding  
- prototyping  
- refinement cycles  

Encourage students to revise both art and code.

---

## 12. Common Mistakes Students Make

- Starting with detail instead of broad shapes  
- Overusing outlines  
- Ignoring value contrast  
- Centering everything  
- Using too many unrelated shapes  
- Forgetting the background is part of the composition  

---

## 13. Teaching Metaphors

- “Draw the big shapes first.” → layout and structure in code.  
- “Squint to see the values.” → simplify to essential components.  
- “Gesture before detail.” → prototype before polish.  
- “Negative space is a shape.” → spacing is a design element.  
- “Form is light traveling across surfaces.” → shading maps in generative art.  

---

## 14. Practice Prompts for Students

- Draw with only circles.  
- Draw with only straight lines.  
- Draw your hand in 30 seconds (gesture).  
- Draw a still life as basic shapes only.  
- Create a composition using foreground, midground, background.  
- Redraw the same object with three different line qualities.
