# Projects

Major creative works for DCDA 30833.

Each project synthesizes techniques from multiple labs into a cohesive system. Projects include:
- `index.html` — HTML wrapper to run your sketch
- `sketch.js` — Your p5.js code
- `README.md` — Artist statement (300-500 words)
- `assets/` — Images, sounds, data files (if needed)
- `process/` — Optional documentation of iterations and experiments

## Project List

| Project | Title | Synthesizes |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 01 | System Self-Portrait | Labs 0-1 (structure, determinism) |
| 02 | Generative Visual Study | Labs 1-3 (rule, chaos, control) |
| 03 | Algorithmic Color Composition | Labs 4-5 (color systems) |
| 04 | Concrete Poem | Labs 6-7 (text, interaction) |
| 05 | Generative Sound | Labs 8-9 (envelope, rhythm) |
| 06 | Data-Driven System | Labs 10-11 (data mapping) |
| Final | Expressive Generative System | Full synthesis |

## Artist Statements

Each project README should address:
- What rules govern your system?
- What behaviors emerge from those rules?
- What did you discover through the process?

Focus on the system's behavior, not what it "means" or "represents."
