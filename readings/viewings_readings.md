# DCDA 30833 --- Viewings & Readings Packet

*Creative Coding for the Humanities*

This packet gathers exemplars for **inspiration and study**, paired to
each major project in the course. These are not meant to be copied. They
are meant to be **ways of thinking in systems**.

The guiding idea across all selections:

> **Form = Content**\
> **Systems dramatize states of thought and feeling**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROJECT 1 --- System-Based Shape Self-Portrait

*Pure Rule · Deterministic Behavior*

### 1. Sol LeWitt --- *Wall Drawings (Instruction-Based Art)*

-   Instruction sets generate the visual work.
-   The artist designs a **rule**, not a composition.
-   Key Idea: *The idea is the machine that makes the art.*

### 2. Casey Reas --- *Software Structures*

-   Minimal code rules produce complex visual behavior.
-   Direct bridge between algorithm and drawing.
-   Key Idea: Repetition + rule = identity.

### 3. Ian Bogost --- *Procedural Rhetoric* (excerpt)

-   Systems express ideas through **process**, not description.
-   Key Idea: Meaning emerges from how a system operates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROJECT 2 --- Generative Visual Study

*Rule + Chaos + Control · Emergence*

### 1. Vera Molnár --- *Early Computer Plotter Drawings*

-   Small deviations inside strict structures.
-   Key Idea: Slight randomness creates vitality.

### 2. Manfred Mohr --- *Algorithmic Abstraction*

-   Logical spaces become visual spaces.
-   Key Idea: The artwork executes a system.

### 3. Philip Galanter --- *What Is Generative Art?*

-   Defines generative systems as partially autonomous.
-   Key Idea: Artists design processes, not outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROJECT 3 --- Algorithmic Color Composition

*Color as Constraint · Palette Behavior*

### 1. Josef Albers --- *Interaction of Color*

-   Color is relational, not fixed.
-   Key Idea: A color's meaning changes with its neighbors.

### 2. Ellsworth Kelly --- *Hard-Edge Color Panels*

-   Color as structure, not ornament.
-   Key Idea: Palette becomes architecture.

### 3. John Maeda --- *Reactive Color* (Creative Code essays)

-   Color becomes time-based behavior.
-   Key Idea: Computation turns color into action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROJECT 4 --- Animated & Interactive Concrete Poem

*Text as Object · Motion · Interaction*

### 1. bpNichol --- *First Screening*

-   Letters as animated objects.
-   Key Idea: Text performs instead of describes.

### 2. J.R. Carpenter --- *This Is a Picture of Wind*

-   Text, motion, interface, and data fused into lyric systems.
-   Key Idea: Poetic affect emerges through procedure.

### 3. Johanna Drucker --- *Performative Materiality* (excerpt)

-   Text and interface as events.
-   Key Idea: Digital text is enacted in time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROJECT 5 --- Generative Sound / Sonified System

*Envelope · Rhythm · Mapping*

### 1. Brian Eno --- *Generative Music / Ambient Systems*

-   Music as an evolving environment.
-   Key Idea: Composition as ongoing behavior.

### 2. Ryoji Ikeda --- *data.tron / test pattern*

-   Data mapped to sound and perception.
-   Key Idea: Sound as measurement and structure.

### 3. Curtis Roads --- *Microsound* (intro excerpt)

-   Sound as particle systems in time.
-   Key Idea: Audio as a field of events, not melody.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROJECT 6 --- Data-Driven Expressive System

*Data as Material · Mapping · Behavior*

### 1. Jer Thorp --- *Early NYT Data Visualizations*

-   Data used to drive generative form.
-   Key Idea: Data becomes expressive material.

### 2. Golan Levin --- *The Dumpster*, *Messa di Voce*

-   Human data transformed into audiovisual behavior.
-   Key Idea: Data performs identity.

### 3. Lev Manovich --- *Info-Aesthetics* (excerpt)

-   Visualization as a cultural and aesthetic act.
-   Key Idea: Mapping is an expressive choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cross-Cutting Theoretical Anchor

### N. Katherine Hayles --- *Pattern vs Presence* (excerpt)

-   Systems prioritize pattern over physical object.
-   Key Idea: What persists is not the thing, but the behavior.

### Matthew Fuller --- *Software Studies* (excerpt)

-   Code is cultural material.
-   Key Idea: Software is not just a tool---it is a medium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Use This Packet

You are invited to:

-   Observe behavior before interpreting meaning
-   Describe rules before describing results
-   Notice:
    -   repetition
    -   variation
    -   constraint
    -   failure
    -   surprise

These works are not models to imitate. They are **systems to think
with**.
