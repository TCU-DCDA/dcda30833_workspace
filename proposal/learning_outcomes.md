# DCDA 30833 — Student Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Synthesize Form and Content:** Demonstrate, through creative projects, how computational structures (loops, conditionals, probability) function as expressive semantic devices rather than mere functional tools.
2.  **Design Generative Systems:** Create software systems that exhibit emergent behavior, moving beyond static composition to design dynamic, rule-based aesthetic experiences.
3.  **Critique Digital Culture:** Analyze and articulate the cultural and ethical implications of algorithms, randomness, and data representation within the humanities.
4.  **Apply Computational Thinking:** Solve aesthetic and conceptual problems using core programming concepts (variables, iteration, functions, objects, and arrays) in a creative context.
5.  **Iterate and Refine:** Employ an iterative design process that prioritizes discovery and system-tuning over predetermined outcomes, documenting the evolution of their code and concepts.
6.  **Bridge Disciplines:** Translate concepts from traditional humanities disciplines (visual art, poetry, music theory) into executable code, fostering interdisciplinary fluency.
