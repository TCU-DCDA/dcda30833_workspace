# Project 01 — System Self-Portrait

**DCDA 30833 — Creative Coding for the Humanities**

## Artist Statement

[Write 300-500 words about your system.]

Consider:
- What rules govern this system?
- What behaviors emerge from those rules?
- How does the system reflect something about how you think, move, or organize?
- What did you discover through the process of building it?

Remember: This is a *system identity*, not a literal portrait. Focus on behavior, motion, and logic — not representation.
