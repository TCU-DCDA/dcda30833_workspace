# DCDA 30833 — Creative Coding for the Humanities
**Formal Syllabus**

**Course Number:** DCDA 30833  
**Credit Hours:** 3  
**Prerequisites:** Basic programming literacy or permission of instructor.

## Course Description
This course introduces creative coding as a method for artistic, literary, and critical expression. Moving beyond functional software development, students explore code as an expressive medium capable of dramatizing complex states of thought and feeling. Through a series of "labs" (technical exercises) and "projects" (creative syntheses), students will build generative visual art, interactive poetry, sonified systems, and data-driven narratives. The course emphasizes the philosophy that **Form = Content**, treating algorithms not as neutral tools but as cultural and aesthetic enactments.

## Student Learning Outcomes
1.  **Synthesize Form and Content:** Demonstrate how computational structures function as expressive semantic devices.
2.  **Design Generative Systems:** Create software that exhibits emergent behavior and dynamic aesthetic experiences.
3.  **Critique Digital Culture:** Analyze the cultural implications of algorithms and data representation.
4.  **Apply Computational Thinking:** Solve aesthetic problems using variables, loops, functions, and objects.
5.  **Iterate and Refine:** Employ an iterative design process prioritizing discovery over predetermined outcomes.

## Course Structure & Methodology
The course is divided into weekly modules combining technical instruction with studio time.
*   **Labs (Weekly):** Low-stakes, technique-focused exercises designed to isolate specific concepts (e.g., "Rule Without Random," "Text as Object").
*   **Projects (Bi-Weekly/Monthly):** Major creative works that synthesize multiple techniques into a cohesive artistic statement.
*   **Critiques:** Regular peer review sessions where code is run live and discussed as an aesthetic object.

## Assessment & Feedback
This course utilizes an **ungrading** model. Focus is placed on process, iteration, and reflection rather than subjective aesthetic judgment or numerical scores.

*   **Labs:** Weekly technical challenges receive qualitative feedback, not grades. Completion and engagement matter more than perfection.
*   **Projects:** Major creative works receive detailed feedback on concept and execution. Accompanied by short artist statements.
*   **Participation & Critique:** Active engagement in code reviews and class discussions is expected and essential for learning.
*   **Final Portfolio & Self-Evaluation:** At semester's end, you will submit a portfolio of your work and a self-evaluation proposing your final grade based on growth, effort, and quality. If the instructor's assessment differs significantly, you will meet to discuss.

**Why Ungrading?** Creative coding requires risk-taking and productive failure. Traditional grading often punishes experimentation, leading to safe, uninteresting work. Ungrading encourages you to explore, break things, and learn from the process.
