# PROJECT 1 --- System-Based Shape Self-Portrait

**Course:** DCDA 30833 --- Creative Coding for the Humanities\
**Due:** Week 2 (Thursday)\
**Tools:** p5.js\
**Submission:** GitHub link to your project folder + short written
reflection

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

This project is your first full **creative coding system** in the
course.

You are not making a drawing *of* yourself. You are designing a
**rule-based visual system** that behaves in a way that reflects
something about how you think, move, repeat, organize, or change.

This project builds directly from:

-   **LAB 0 --- Structure & Surface as Systems**
-   **LAB 1 --- Rule Without Random**

At this stage, your system must be:

-   **fully rule-based**
-   **deterministic**
-   **free of randomness**

This ensures that your focus is on **structure and behavior**, not
chance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Requirements

-   Use **p5.js**
-   Be **rule-based only** (no randomness, no noise)
-   Use:
    -   motion
    -   repetition
    -   transformation
-   Run continuously using `draw()`
-   Produce a recognizable **system identity**
-   Default canvas: `400 × 400`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What You May Use

-   `frameCount`
-   `sin()` and `cos()`
-   loops
-   `translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What You May NOT Use

-   `random()`
-   `noise()`
-   images
-   external data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reflection (5--7 Sentences)

What rule defines your system?\
How does it change over time?\
What surprised you?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Course Arc

This project establishes your ability to design **pure rule-based
form**.
