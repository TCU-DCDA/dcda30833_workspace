# Slide Deck: Discovery Over Expression

**Course:** DCDA 30833 — Creative Coding for the Humanities
**Use:** Week 1 introduction or as recurring reference throughout semester
**Duration:** ~40 minutes (conceptual framing session)

---

## Slide 1: Title

**DISCOVERY OVER EXPRESSION**

What if art isn't about saying what you mean?

---

**Speaker Notes:**
This deck introduces the central philosophical shift of the course. We'll challenge the assumption that creative work is about "expressing yourself" and propose an alternative: art as a process of discovering what a system can reveal.

---

## Slide 2: The Default Assumption

> "What do I want to say?"

This is how we're taught to approach creative work.

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Most students arrive with this framing — art as autobiography, as message, as self-expression. This isn't wrong, but it's limited. It places the artist's intention at the center and treats the medium as a delivery mechanism.

Ask students: When you've made something creative before, did you start with what you wanted to say?

---

## Slide 3: The Alternative

> "What can this system reveal?"

This is how we'll work in this course.

---

**Speaker Notes:**
We're shifting from expression to discovery. Instead of encoding a predetermined message, we'll design systems (code, rules, constraints) and observe what emerges. The system becomes a collaborator, not a tool.

---

## Slide 4: Picasso

> "In my opinion to search means nothing in painting. To find is the thing."

— Pablo Picasso, "Picasso Speaks," *The Arts*, 1923

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Picasso distinguished between searching (working toward a known goal) and finding (encountering the unexpected). The condensed version "I do not seek. I find." captures this — the artist as discoverer, not planner.

## Slide 5: Frost

> "No surprise for the writer, no surprise for the reader."

— Robert Frost, "The Figure a Poem Makes," 1939

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Frost argued that if the writer already knows the ending, the poem is dead on arrival. The act of writing *is* the discovery. This applies directly to generative systems: if you've predetermined the output, why use code at all?

## Slide 6: Cage

> "I use chance operations instead of operating according to my likes and dislikes."

— John Cage

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Cage used the I Ching to make compositional decisions, removing his ego from the process. He wasn't interested in what he wanted to say — he was interested in what the system of chance could reveal. This is self-alteration, not self-expression.

Cage described disciplined use of chance as "meant for discovery."

---

## Slide 7: Richter

> "I want to end up with a picture that I haven't planned."

— Gerhard Richter

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Richter's squeegee paintings involve applying and removing paint through chance processes. He's said: "I'm often astonished to find how much better chance is than I am." The painter collaborates with accident.

## Slide 8: LeWitt

> "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art."

— Sol LeWitt, "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art," 1967

---

**Speaker Notes:**
LeWitt's wall drawings were executed by others following his instructions. The artist doesn't control every mark — the system does. And yet identity emerges. The rules *are* the art.

This is exactly how we'll think about code: not as a tool for illustrating ideas, but as a generative system that produces outcomes we couldn't have planned.

---

## Slide 9: Cunningham

> "My main interest is, as always, in discovery."

— Merce Cunningham

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Cunningham used chance operations to determine choreographic sequences. Dancers didn't know which phrase came next until the I Ching decided. Paradoxically, this produced not chaos but order — and genuine surprise.

---

## Slide 10: Klee

> "An active line on a walk, moving freely, without goal."

— Paul Klee, *Pedagogical Sketchbook*, 1925

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Klee didn't say "a line expressing the artist's intention." He said a line *on a walk* — exploring, discovering, without predetermined destination. Drawing as wandering. Code can work the same way.

---

## Slide 11: Eno

> "One of the things art offers you is the chance to surrender."

— Brian Eno

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Eno's Oblique Strategies are prompts that push artists sideways when they're stuck. They disrupt intention. "Honor thy error as a hidden intention." The creative act includes giving up control.

---

## Slide 12: Doctorow

> "Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way."

— E.L. Doctorow, *Paris Review* interview, 1988

---

**Speaker Notes:**
You don't need to see the whole journey to begin. You only need to see the next step. This is how we'll work with code — iteratively, responsively, discovering the shape of the thing as we go.

---

## Slide 13: The Shift

| Expression | Discovery |
|------------|-----------|
| "What do I want to say?" | "What can this system reveal?" |
| Artist as author | Artist as collaborator |
| Medium as tool | Medium as partner |
| Outcome predetermined | Outcome emergent |
| Success = intention realized | Success = surprise |

---

**Speaker Notes:**
This table summarizes the philosophical shift. We're not abandoning intentionality — we're expanding it to include the agency of the system. The code pushes back. The randomness has preferences. The constraints generate.

---

## Slide 14: Why This Matters for Creative Coding

Code is a system.

Systems have behaviors.

Behaviors can surprise you.

---

**Speaker Notes:**
When you write a `for` loop, you're not drawing 100 circles — you're defining a *rule* that draws circles. The rule is the art. And rules have consequences you didn't plan for. That's the good part.

---

## Slide 15: Discussion

**In pairs (3 minutes):**

1. Think of a time you made something and were surprised by the result.
2. What created the surprise? Accident? Constraint? A tool's behavior?
3. Was the surprise good or bad? Did you keep it?

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Give students time to surface their own experiences of discovery in creative work. Many will have examples but not have framed them this way. The goal is to make the concept personal before we return to theory.

---

## Slide 16: The Course Philosophy

**Form = Content**
Structure is meaning, not decoration.

**Systems Dramatize States**
Code performs — it doesn't represent.

**Discovery Over Expression**
We explore what systems reveal.

---

**Speaker Notes:**
These three principles will recur throughout the semester. Today we've focused on the third. In coming weeks, we'll see how constraints (form), behaviors (systems), and emergence (discovery) work together.

---

## Slide 17: Exit Prompt

On a notecard or in your notes:

> Name one assumption about "expressing yourself" through art that you're willing to question this semester.

---

**Speaker Notes:**
Collect these or have students keep them. This becomes a reference point for the final reflection — has their thinking changed?

---
