## Project Overview

This repository contains course development materials for **DCDA 30833 – Creative Coding for the Humanities**, an upper-division elective that teaches creative coding as a method for artistic, literary, and critical expression within digital culture.

**Course Focus Areas:**
- Generative art
- Interactive poetry
- Browser-based musical instruments
- Data-driven creative works
- AI-assisted writing systems

**Core Philosophy:** Form = Content · Systems Dramatize States · Discovery over Expression

## Pedagogical Philosophy

This course material is built on specific theoretical foundations that should inform any AI assistance:

### Core Principles

1. **Form = Content**
   - Form is not a container for meaning; form *is* the meaning
   - Logical structures, behaviors, and system dynamics *perform* content
   - Applies across drawing, color, sound, poetry, and generative systems

2. **Systems as Dramatizations**
   - Like poems, generative systems don't "have" meaning—they dramatize states
   - Systems express through what they *do*, not what the artist intends
   - Focus on behavior, motion, logic, emergence, and interaction

3. **Discovery over Expression**
   - Shift from "What do I want to say?" to "What can this system reveal?"
   - Generative and interactive systems resist autobiographical expression
   - Students explore behavior rather than encode predetermined meaning

4. **Constraints as Engines of Creativity**
   - Constraints don't limit creativity; they generate it
   - Systems push back—and that pushback is productive
   - Use randomness, noise, thresholds, and interaction as creative constraints

## AI Assistance Guidelines

### Critical Rules

**IMPORTANT: Review these rules after every 8 exchanges in a conversation.**

1. **No Assumptions or Unauthorized Changes**
   - Never make assumptions about code behavior or requirements
   - Do not make changes to code unless explicitly requested
   - Always ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
   - Read existing code before suggesting any modifications

2. **Language Usage**
   - Do not use the word "master" (use "main," "primary," "parent," or context-appropriate alternatives)
   - Use emojis sparingly if at all—prefer clear, professional text

3. **Review Cycle**
   - After every 8 message exchanges, pause and review these guidelines
   - Ensure compliance with all rules and pedagogical principles

### When Helping with Course Materials

**DO:**
- Maintain the course's philosophical stance that systems are performative, not illustrative
- Use language that emphasizes discovery, exploration, and emergence
- Frame coding challenges as opportunities to explore system behavior
- Reference existing theory sheets when applicable
- Keep explanations accessible to humanities students with basic programming literacy
- Support p5.js and JavaScript as primary creative coding environments
- Encourage iterative experimentation over perfect planning

**DON'T:**
- Frame creative coding as "self-expression" or autobiographical art
- Suggest that code is merely a tool to "decorate ideas with technology"
- Use overly technical jargon without humanities-centered framing
- Imply that generative art has "hidden meanings" to decode
- Oversimplify the creative or conceptual aspects of the work

### When Creating Assignments

- Include clear learning objectives tied to both technical skills and conceptual understanding
- Provide room for student discovery and unexpected outcomes
- Balance structure with openness to emergence
- Consider how constraints might generate creativity
- Frame evaluation criteria around both process and product
- **Do not assign points or weights** — this course uses an ungrading system
- Focus on learning goals and reflection rather than numerical scores

### When Writing Theory Sheets

- Use clear, concise language appropriate for upper-division humanities students
- Include practical code examples alongside conceptual explanations
- Connect technical concepts to aesthetic or expressive possibilities
- Maintain consistency with existing cheat sheet style and format
- Reference relevant artists, movements, or theoretical frameworks when appropriate

### When Developing Code Examples

- Prioritize readability and pedagogical clarity over optimization
- Comment code to explain *why*, not just *what*
- Demonstrate concepts through multiple small examples rather than one complex example
- Show progressive complexity (basic → intermediate → advanced)
- Use variable names that are semantically meaningful
- Follow p5.js conventions and best practices

## Technical Context

**Primary Technologies:**
- JavaScript (p5.js for creative coding)
- Browser-based development
- Possible use of Web Audio API, Canvas API
- May include AI/ML tools for creative applications

**Student Prerequisites:**
- Basic programming literacy in JavaScript or Python
- No prior creative coding experience required

## Audience

Materials are designed for:
- Upper-division (3000-level) undergraduate students
- Humanities backgrounds with basic programming literacy
- Interest in creative, artistic, or critical applications of code
- Digital Culture and Data Analytics (DCDA) program context

## Course-Specific Terminology

- **Dramatize**: Systems or poems perform states rather than contain messages
- **State**: A condition of thought, feeling, behavior, or motion enacted by a system
- **Emergence**: Behavior that arises from system rules rather than explicit programming
- **Constraint**: A generative limitation that produces creative possibilities
- **Form = Content**: The structural/behavioral qualities *are* the meaning, not a vessel for it

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is active course development; materials may be incomplete or evolving
- Instructor has a background in poetry and humanities computing
- Course emphasizes computational thinking within humanities inquiry
- Balance technical rigor with creative play and critical reflection
- Support both instructor development tasks and student-facing content creation
- When in doubt about pedagogical approach, refer to [context/theory_foundations.md](context/theory_foundations.md)

## Questions to Ask When Uncertain

1. Is this explanation too technical for humanities students?
2. Does this framing support "discovery over expression"?
3. Am I treating code as a decorative tool rather than an expressive medium?
4. Does this assignment allow for unexpected emergence?
5. Is this constraint generative or merely limiting?
