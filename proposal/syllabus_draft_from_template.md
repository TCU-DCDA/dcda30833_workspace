## Course Description *

### Catalog Description *
DCDA 30833 introduces creative coding as a method for artistic, literary, and critical expression within digital culture. Moving beyond functional software development, students explore code as an expressive medium capable of dramatizing complex states of thought and feeling. Through a series of "labs" (technical exercises) and "projects" (creative syntheses), students will build generative visual art, interactive poetry, sonified systems, and data-driven narratives.

### Prerequisites & Concurrent Enrollment *
*   **Prerequisite:** Basic programming literacy in JavaScript or Python, or permission of instructor.

### Program & Major Connections
This course serves as an upper-division elective for the DCDA minor/major, bridging the gap between technical proficiency and humanistic inquiry. It prepares students for advanced work in digital media, interaction design, and digital humanities research.

## Teaching Philosophy & Methodology
**Form = Content · Systems Dramatize States · Discovery over Expression**

My teaching philosophy posits that code is not merely a functional tool but a cultural material. In this course, we shift away from "self-expression" (what do I want to say?) towards **system discovery** (what can this system reveal?). We treat logical structures—loops, conditionals, probabilities—as aesthetic enactments. Learning occurs through **iterative play**, where failure is treated as a generative data point rather than an error.

---

## Learning Outcomes *

### Course Learning Outcomes *
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.  **Synthesize Form and Content:** Demonstrate how computational structures function as expressive semantic devices.
2.  **Design Generative Systems:** Create software that exhibits emergent behavior and dynamic aesthetic experiences.
3.  **Critique Digital Culture:** Analyze the cultural implications of algorithms and data representation.
4.  **Apply Computational Thinking:** Solve aesthetic problems using variables, loops, functions, and objects.
5.  **Iterate and Refine:** Employ an iterative design process prioritizing discovery over predetermined outcomes.

## Course Requirements *

### Assignments *
The course is driven by two main types of work:
1.  **Labs (Weekly):** Low-stakes, technique-focused exercises designed to isolate specific concepts (e.g., "Rule Without Random," "Text as Object").
2.  **Projects (Bi-Weekly/Monthly):** Major creative works that synthesize multiple techniques into a cohesive artistic statement.

### Quizzes & Exams
There are no traditional exams. Assessment is project-based.

### Formal Writing & Research
Students will write short **Artist Statements** (300-500 words) for each major project, articulating their conceptual goals and technical execution.

### Labs, Presentations & Critiques
**Critiques** are central to this course. We will regularly run code live in class to discuss it as an aesthetic object. Active participation in giving and receiving feedback is required.

### Final Evaluative Exercise
**Final Project: Expressive Generative System.** A major, self-directed work that synthesizes the semester's concepts.

## Grading Philosophy & Policy

### Grading Scale(s) *
This course utilizes an **Ungrading** philosophy. This means I will not assign letter grades to individual assignments. Instead, we will focus on qualitative feedback, self-reflection, and iterative improvement.

*   **Feedback:** You will receive detailed feedback on your code and concepts.
*   **Self-Evaluation:** You will regularly reflect on your own learning and progress.
*   **Final Grade:** At the end of the semester, you will submit a portfolio and a self-evaluation proposing your final grade based on your growth, effort, and the quality of your work. If my assessment differs significantly from yours, we will meet to discuss it.

**Why Ungrading?**
Creative coding requires risk-taking and failure. A traditional grading system often punishes failure, leading to safe, boring work. Ungrading encourages you to experiment, break things, and learn from the process without fear of a low grade.

### Late Work *
*   **Labs:** Accepted up to 1 week late. The goal is completion and learning, not penalty.
*   **Projects:** Should be submitted on time for critique. Late projects may miss the critique window, which limits feedback opportunities and peer learning.

### Participation, Engagement & Attendance *
Coding is a practice, not just a theory. Attendance in studio sessions is critical for debugging and peer learning.

## Course Policies

### Technology Policies
Students are expected to bring their laptops to every class. AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT) are permitted *as assistants* but must be cited. You must be able to explain every line of code you submit.
