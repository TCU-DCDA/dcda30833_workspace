## 📖 Course Philosophy

This course moves away from "self-expression" and towards **system discovery**. We treat code not as a tool to execute a pre-planned image, but as a medium to dramatize behaviors, probabilities, and logic.

> "Poems don’t have meaning. They dramatize states of thought and states of feeling."
